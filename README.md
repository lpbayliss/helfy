# Helfy - Personal Health & Fitness Intelligence Platform

A comprehensive self-hosted suite for tracking biometric data, managing health metrics, and building a personalized fitness knowledgebase that evolves into your personal health assistant.

## Vision

Helfy aims to bridge the gap between data collection and actionable health insights by combining:

- **Personal Health Tracking**: Comprehensive biometric and fitness data collection
- **Knowledge Management**: Curated database of exercises, routines, muscles, nutrition, and health information
- **Intelligent Insights**: AI-powered analysis that transforms your data into personalized recommendations

## Core Components

### ðŸ“Š Data Tracking & Analytics
- **Biometric Monitoring**: Weight, body composition, heart rate, sleep patterns, recovery metrics
- **Fitness Logging**: Workouts, exercise performance, progression tracking, training volume
- **Nutrition Tracking**: Meal logging, macro/micronutrient analysis, dietary patterns
- **Health Metrics**: Mood, energy levels, symptoms, medication tracking, lab results
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Stress levels, hydration, activity patterns, environmental factors

### ðŸ§  Knowledge Base
- **Exercise Library**: Comprehensive database with proper form, muscle targets, variations, progressions
- **Routine Templates**: Proven workout programs categorized by goals, experience level, equipment
- **Anatomy & Physiology**: Muscle groups, movement patterns, biomechanics, injury prevention
- **Nutrition Database**: Food profiles, recipes, meal planning templates, dietary strategies
- **Health Resources**: Evidence-based health information, condition management, wellness protocols

### ðŸ¤– Personal Health Assistant
- **Intelligent Analysis**: Pattern recognition in your health and fitness data
- **Personalized Recommendations**: 
  - Exercise suggestions based on goals, progress, and recovery status

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js + TypeScript + Hono**: Lightweight, high-performance web framework with excellent TypeScript support
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database interactions with full TypeScript integration
- **Temporal**: Durable workflow engine for complex health data processing and long-term program tracking

### Database Architecture
- **TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL)**: Time-series data for personal health metrics
  - Biometric tracking (weight, measurements, sleep, activity)
  - Workout logging (exercises, sets, reps, progression)
  - Nutrition tracking (meals, calories, macronutrients)
  - Advanced time-series analytics and trend analysis
  
- **Neo4j**: Knowledge base and relationship graphs
  - Exercise library with muscle group relationships
  - Food database with nutritional correlations
  - Future: Personal insights and recommendation graphs

### Frontend
- **Vike + React + TypeScript**: Framework-agnostic meta-framework with minimal vendor lock-in
- **Data Visualization**: D3, Chart.js, Recharts for health analytics
- **Mobile**: React Native for cross-platform mobile applications
- **PWA Support**: Offline-first capabilities for reliable tracking

### Infrastructure
- **Docker + Docker Compose**: Self-hosted deployment with persistent data volumes
- **Home Server Optimized**: Designed for reliable personal/family deployment

## Getting Started

**Current Status**: Architecture planning complete, ready for implementation

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for development)

**Next Steps:**
1. Setup core infrastructure (PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB, Neo4j, Temporal)
2. Implement Hono API server with Drizzle ORM
3. Create Vike frontend for data visualization
4. Build initial health tracking workflows

See `docs/implementation-roadmap.md` for detailed development plan.
